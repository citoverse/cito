## Setup - Installing torch

Before using 'cito' make sure that the current version of 'torch' is installed and running.


```r
if(!require(torch)) install.packages("torch")
#> Loading required package: torch
library(torch)
if(!torch_is_installed()) install_torch()

library (cito)
```

If you have problems installing Torch, check out the [installation help from the torch developer](https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/articles/installation.html).

## Introduction to models and model structures

### Loss functions / Likelihoods

Cito can handle many different response types. Common loss functions from ML but also likelihoods for statistical models are supported:

|                 |                           |                                                                         |                                               |
|:----------------|:----------------|:--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Name            | Explanation               | Example / Task                                                          | Meta-Code                                     |
| `mse`           | mean squared error        | Regression, predicting continuous values                                | `dnn(Sepal.Length~., ..., loss = "mse")`      |
| `mae`           | mean absolute error       | Regression, predicting continuous values                                | `dnn(Sepal.Length~., ..., loss = "msa")`      |
| `softmax`       | categorical cross entropy | Multi-class, species classification                                     | `dnn(Species~., ..., loss = "softmax")`       |
| `cross-entropy` | categorical cross entropy | Multi-class, species classification                                     | `dnn(Species~., ..., loss = "cross-entropy")` |
| `gaussian`      | Normal likelihood         | Regression, residual error is also estimated (similar to `stats::lm()`) | `dnn(Sepal.Length~., ..., loss = "gaussian")` |
| `binomial`      | Binomial likelihood       | Classification/Logistic regression, mortality (0/1 data)                | `dnn(Presence~., ..., loss = "Binomial")`     |
| `poisson`       | Poisson likelihood        | Regression, count data, e.g. species abundances                         | `dnn(Abundance~., ..., loss = "Poisson")`     |

Moreover, all non multilabel losses (all except for softmax or cross-entropy) can be modeled as multilabel using the cbind syntax

`dnn(cbind(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)~., â€¦, loss = "mse")`

The likelihoods (Gaussian, Binomial, and Poisson) can be also passed as their stats equivalents:

`dnn(Sepal.Length~., ..., loss = stats::gaussian)`

### Data

In this vignette, we will work with the irirs dataset and build a regression model.


```r
data <- datasets::iris
head(data)
#>   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
#> 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
#> 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
#> 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
#> 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
#> 5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
#> 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa

#scale dataset
data <- data.frame(scale(data[,-5]),Species = data[,5])
```

### Fitting a simple model

In 'cito', neural networks are specified and fitted with the `dnn()` function. Models can also be trained on the GPU by setting `device = "cuda"`(but only if you have installed the CUDA dependencies). This is suggested if you are working with large data sets or networks.


```r
library(cito)

#fitting a regression model to predict Sepal.Length
nn.fit <- dnn(Sepal.Length~. , data = data, epochs = 12, loss = "mse", verbose=FALSE)
```

You can plot the network structure to give you a visual feedback of the created object. e aware that this may take some time for large networks.


```r
plot(nn.fit)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="A/A-plotnn-1.png" alt="plot of chunk plotnn"  />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk plotnn</p>
</div>

The neural network 5 input nodes (3 continoues features, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width and the contrasts for the Species variable (n_classes - 1)) and 1 output node for the response (Sepal.Length).

### Baseline loss

At the start of the training we calculate a baseline loss for an an intercept only model. It allows us to control the training because the goal is to beat the baseline loss. If we don't, we need to adjust the optimization parameters (epochs and lr (learning rate)):


```r
nn.fit <- dnn(Sepal.Length~. , data = data, epochs = 50, lr = 0.6, loss = "mse", verbose = FALSE) # lr too high
#> Error in eval_bare(loop, env): Loss is NA. Bad training, please check learning rate or regularization strength. See vignette('02_Troubleshooting') for help.
```

<img src="A/A-unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2"  />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2</p>
</div>

vs


```r
nn.fit <- dnn(Sepal.Length~. , data = data, epochs = 50, lr = 0.01, loss = "mse", verbose = FALSE)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="A/A-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3"  />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3</p>
</div>

See `vignette("B-Training_neural_networks"`) for more details on how to adjust the optimization procedure and increase the probability of convergence.

### Adding a validation set to the training process

In order to see where your model might suffer from overfitting the addition of a validation set can be useful. With `dnn()` you can put `validation = 0.x` and define a percentage that will not be used for training and only for validation after each epoch. During training, a loss plot will show you how the two losses behave (see `vignette("B-Training_neural_networks"`) for details on training NN and guaranteeing their convergence).


```r
#20% of data set is used as validation set
nn.fit <- dnn(Sepal.Length~., data = data, epochs = 32,
              loss= "mse", validation = 0.2)
```

Weights oft the last and the epoch with the lowest validation loss are saved:


```r
length(nn.fit$weights)
#> [1] 2
```

The default is to use the weights of the last epoch. But we can also tell the model to use the weights with the lowest validation loss:


```r
nn.fit$use_model_epoch = 1 # Default, use last epoch
nn.fit$use_model_epoch = 2 # Use weights from epoch with lowest validation loss
```

### Methods

cito supports many of the well-known methods from other statistical packages:


```r
predict(nn.fit)
coef(nn.fit)
print(nn.fit)
```

## Explainable AI - Understanding your model

xAI can produce outputs that are similar to known outputs from statistical models:

The `summary()` returns feature importance, ACE and SDCE:


```r

```


```r
#returns weights of neural network

```

### Uncertainties/p-Values

We can use bootstrapping to obtain uncertainties for the xAI metrics (and also for the predictions). For that we have to retrain our model with enabled bootstrapping:


```r
df = data
df[,2:4] = scale(df[,2:4]) # scaling can help the NN to convergence faster
nn.fit <- dnn(Sepal.Length~., data = df,
              epochs = 100,
              verbose = FALSE,
              loss= "mse",
              bootstrap = 30L
              )
```


```r
summary(nn.fit)
#> Summary of Deep Neural Network Model
#> 
#> â”€â”€ Feature Importance
#>                             Importance Std.Err Z value Pr(>|z|)

#> ---
#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

We find that Petal.Length and Sepal.Width are significant (categorical features are not supported yet for average conditional effects).

Let's compare the output to statistical outputs:


```r
anova(lm(Sepal.Length~., data = df))
#> Analysis of Variance Table
#> 
#> Response: Sepal.Length
#>               Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq  F value    Pr(>F)    
#> Sepal.Width    1   2.060   2.060  15.0011 0.0001625 ***
#> Petal.Length   1 123.127 123.127 896.8059 < 2.2e-16 ***
#> Petal.Width    1   2.747   2.747  20.0055 1.556e-05 ***
#> Species        2   1.296   0.648   4.7212 0.0103288 *  
#> Residuals    144  19.770   0.137                       
#> ---
#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

Feature importance and the anova report Petal.Length as the most important feature.

Visualization of the effects:


```r
PDP(nn.fit)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="A/A-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9"  />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9</p>
</div>


```r
library(effects)
#> Loading required package: carData
#> lattice theme set by effectsTheme()
#> See ?effectsTheme for details.
plot(allEffects(lm(Sepal.Length~., data = df)))
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="A/A-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10"  />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10</p>
</div>

There are some differences between the statistical model and the NN - which is to be expected because the NN can fit the data more flexible. But at the same time the differences have large confidence intervals (e.g. the effect of Petal.Width)

## Architecture

The architecture in NN usually refers to the width and depth of the hidden layers (the layers between the input and the output layer) and their activation functions. You can increase the complexity of the NN by adding layers and/or making them wider:


```r
# "simple NN" - low complexity
nn.fit <- dnn(Sepal.Length~., data = data, epochs = 100,
              loss= "mse", validation = 0.2,
              hidden = c(5L), verbose=FALSE)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="A/A-unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11"  />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11</p>
</div>

```r

# "large NN" - high complexity
nn.fit <- dnn(Sepal.Length~., data = data, epochs = 100,
              loss= "mse", validation = 0.2,
              hidden = c(100L, 100), verbose=FALSE)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="A/A-unnamed-chunk-11-2.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11"  />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11</p>
</div>

There is no definitive guide to choosing the right architecture for the right task. However, there are some general rules/recommendations: In general, wider, and deeper neural networks can improve generalization - but this is a double-edged sword because it also increases the risk of overfitting. So, if you increase the width and depth of the network, you should also add regularization (e.g., by increasing the lambda parameter, which corresponds to the regularization strength). Furthermore, in [Pichler & Hartig, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10551), we investigated the effects of the hyperparameters on the prediction performance as a function of the data size. For example, we found that the `selu` activation function outperforms `relu` for small data sizes (\<100 observations).

We recommend starting with moderate sizes (like the defaults), and if the model doesn't generalize/converge, try larger networks along with a regularization that helps to minimize the risk of overfitting (see `vignette("B-Training_neural_networks")` ).

#### Activation functions

By default, all layers are fitted with SeLU as activation function. $$
relu(x) = max (0,x)
$$You can also adjust the activation function of each layer individually to build exactly the network you want. In this case you have to provide a vector the same length as there are hidden layers. The activation function of the output layer is chosen with the loss argument and does not have to be provided.


```r
#selu as activation function for all layers:
nn.fit <- dnn(Sepal.Length~., data = data, hidden = c(10,10,10,10), activation= "relu")
#layer specific activation functions:
nn.fit <- dnn(Sepal.Length~., data = data,
              hidden = c(10,10,10,10), activation= c("relu","selu","tanh","sigmoid"))
```

Note: The default activation function should be adequate for most tasks. We don't recommend tuning it.

## Training hyperparameters

### Regularization

#### Elastic net regularization

If elastic net is used, 'cito' will produce a sparse, generalized neural network. The L1/L2 loss can be controlled with the arguments alpha and lambda.

$$
 loss = \lambda * [ (1 - \alpha) * |weights| + \alpha |weights|^2 ]
$$



```r
#elastic net penalty in all layers:
nn.fit <- dnn(Species~., data = data, alpha = 0.5, lambda = 0.01, verbose=FALSE, loss = "softmax")
```

#### Dropout Regularization

Dropout regularization as proposed in [Srivastava et al.](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf?utm_content=buffer79b43&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer,) can be controlled similar to elastic net regularization. In this approach, a percentage of different nodes gets left during each epoch.


```r
#dropout of 35% on all layers:
nn.fit <- dnn(Species~., data = data, loss = "softmax", dropout = 0.35, verbose=FALSE)
#dropout of 35% only on last 2 layers:
nn.fit <- dnn(Species~., data = data, loss = "softmax", dropout = c(0, 0, 0.35, 0.35), verbose=FALSE)
```

### Learning rate

### Learning rate scheduler

Learning rate scheduler allow you to start with a high learning rate and decrease it during the training process. This leads to an overall faster training. You can choose between different types of schedulers. Namely, lambda, multiplicative, one_cycle and step.

The function config_lr_scheduler() helps you setup such a scheduler. See ?config_lr_scheduler() for more information


```r
# Step Learning rate scheduler that reduces learning rate every 16 steps by a factor of 0.5
scheduler <- config_lr_scheduler(type = "step",
                                 step_size = 16,
                                 gamma = 0.5)

nn.fit <- dnn(Sepal.Length~., data = data,lr = 0.01, lr_scheduler= scheduler, verbose = FALSE)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="A/A-lr_scheduler-1.png" alt="plot of chunk lr_scheduler"  />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk lr_scheduler</p>
</div>

### Optimizer

Optimizer are responsible for fitting the neural network. The optimizer tries to minimize the loss function. As default the stochastic gradient descent is used. Custom optimizers can be used with `config_optimizer()`.\
See `?config_optimizer()` for more information.


```r

# adam optimizer with learning rate 0.002, betas to 0.95, 0.999 and eps to 1.5e-08
opt <- config_optimizer(
  type = "sgd")

nn.fit <- dnn(Species~., data = data,  optimizer = opt, lr=0.002, verbose=FALSE, loss = "softmax")
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="A/A-optim-1.png" alt="plot of chunk optim"  />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk optim</p>
</div>

### Early Stopping

Adding early stopping criteria helps you save time by stopping the training process early, if the validation loss of the current epoch is bigger than the validation loss n epochs early. The n can be defined by the early_stopping argument. It is required to set validation \> 0.


```r
# Stops training if validation loss at current epoch is bigger than that 15 epochs earlier
nn.fit <- dnn(Sepal.Length~., data = data, epochs = 1000,
              validation = 0.2, early_stopping = 15, verbose=FALSE)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="A/A-early_stopping-1.png" alt="plot of chunk early_stopping"  />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk early_stopping</p>
</div>

## Continue training process

You can continue the training process of an existing model with continue_training().


```r
# simple example, simply adding another 12 epochs to the training process
nn.fit <- continue_training(nn.fit, epochs = 12, verbose=FALSE)
head(predict(nn.fit))
#>            [,1]
#> [1,] -0.9836558
#> [2,] -1.4395623
#> [3,] -1.3351157
#> [4,] -1.3388002
#> [5,] -0.8847700

It also allows you to change any training parameters, for example the learning rate. You can analyze the training process with analyze_training().


```r

# picking the model with the smalles validation loss
# with changed parameters, in this case a smaller learning rate and a smaller batchsize
nn.fit <- continue_training(nn.fit,
                            epochs = 32,
                            changed_params = list(lr = 0.001, batchsize = 16),
                            verbose = FALSE)
```

## Details about the internal implementation of â€˜citoâ€™


### Internal Data Representation

Tabular data are typically supplied to cito as a data.frame in the usual encoding via the data argument. Categorical data are processed internally using the model.matrix functions from the R 'stats' package. Categorical features are automatically one-hot encoded (no reference level). The data are then split into a feature matrix (variables) and a response matrix. 

The training of the neural networks is based on stochastic gradient descent, which involves sampling random batches of data at each optimization step. To optimize the sampling and subsetting of the data, 'torch' provides optimized data loader objects that create data iterators (objects that iterate once over the data set corresponding to an epoch). The feature and response matrices are passed to 'torch' data loaders that reside on the CPU (to avoid memory overflows on the GPU, if available).

### Construction of the neural networks

Neural networks (NN) are built using the 'nn_sequential' object from the 'torch' package. nn_sequential' expects a list of layers and then returns a fully functional neural network object. It also initializes all weights of the layers. The list of layers is built based on user input, in particular the hidden argument for the number and size of hidden layers, and the activation argument for the corresponding activation layers.

### Training and Evaluation

Once the NN structure and data are prepared, the actual training starts (the baseline loss is also calculated before the training starts). The training consists of two loops. An outer loop for the number of epochs (one epoch means that the data has been used once to update the weights). And an inner loop for the stochastic gradient descent, i.e. for n = 100 observations and batch size = 20, it takes 5 batches of data to traverse the dataset once. 

At each step of the inner loop, the optimizer is reset, a batch of data is returned from the data iterator (initialized at each epoch by the data loader), split into feature and response tensors, pushed to the GPU (if one is available), the feature matrix is passed to the NN for prediction, the average loss is computed based on the response tensor and the predictions, the average loss is backpropagated, and the weights are updated by the optimizer based on the backpropagated errors. This inner loop is repeated until the dataset has been used once, completing the epoch. The process is then repeated for n epochs.

If validation is turned on, after each epoch the model is evaluated on the validation holdout (which was separated from the data at the beginning).

### Transferability

To make the model portable (e.g. save and reload the model), the weights are stored as R matrices in the final object of the 'dnn' function. This is necessary because the 'torch' objects are just pointers to the corresponding data structures. Naively, storing these pointers is pointless, because after the R session ends, the memory is freed and the pointers are meaningless.
