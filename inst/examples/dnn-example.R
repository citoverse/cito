# Example workflow in cito

## Build and train  Network
### softmax is used for multi-class responses (e.g., Species)
nn.fit<- dnn(Species~., data = datasets::iris, loss = "cross-entropy")

## The training loss is below the baseline loss but at the end of the
## training the loss was still decreasing, so continue training for another 50
## epochs
nn.fit <- continue_training(nn.fit, epochs = 50L)

# Sturcture of Neural Network
print(nn.fit)

# Plot Neural Network
plot(nn.fit)
## 4 Input nodes (first layer) because of 4 features
## 3 Output nodes (last layer) because of 3 response species (one node for each
## level in the response variable).
## The layers between the input and output layer are called hidden layers (two
## of them)

## We now want to understand how the predictions are made, what are the
## important features? The summary function automatically calculates feature
## importance (the interpretation is similar to an anova) and calculates
## average conditional effects that are similar to linear effects:
summary(nn.fit)

## To visualize the effect (response-feature effect), we can use the ALE and
## PDP functions

# Partial dependencies
PDP(nn.fit, variable = "Petal.Length")

# Accumulated local effect plots
ALE(nn.fit, variable = "Petal.Length")



# Per se, it is difficult to get confidence intervals for our xAI metrics (or
# for the predictions). But we can use bootstrapping to obtain uncertainties
# for all cito outputs:
## Re-fit the neural network with bootstrapping
nn.fit<- dnn(Species~.,
             data = datasets::iris,
             loss = "cross-entropy",
             epochs = 150L,
             verbose = FALSE,
             bootstrap = 20L)
## convergence can be tested via the analyze_training function
analyze_training(nn.fit)

## Summary for xAI metrics (can take some time):
summary(nn.fit)
## Now with standard errors and p-values
## Note: Take the p-values with a grain of salt! We do not know yet if they are
## correct (e.g. if you use regularization, they are likely conservative == too
## large)

## Predictions with bootstrapping:
dim(predict(nn.fit))
## predictions are by default averaged (over the bootstrap samples)

## Multinomial and conditional logit regression
m = dnn(Species~., data = iris, loss = "clogit", lr = 0.01)
